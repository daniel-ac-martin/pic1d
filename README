Example - The 2-stream instability
----------------------------------

To simulate the 2-stream instability call pic1d with the following arguments:

	pic1d -l 6.283 -p 512 -t 0.1 -T 500 -W 1 \
	      --species -P 2048 -m 1 -q -1 -w 1 --v0 1 --x1 0.0001 \
	      --species -P 2048 -m 1 -q -1 -w 1 --v0 -1 --x1 -0.0001
