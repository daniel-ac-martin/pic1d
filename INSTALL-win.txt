Introduction
============

You have two options for installing this package on Windows. You can
install a binaries provided (assuming you have the Windows binary
package as opposed to the standard source package) or you can build from
the source code. Both these methods are described below.

Installing the Binary
=====================

Simply copy the directory in which this file resides to a place of your
choosing. In most cases you would want to copy it into 
`C:/Program Files' but this need not be the case.

   The binaries for this package are to be found in the bin/ directory. If
you want to make shortcuts to the program (for example in your `Start
Menu') you should make them to these files.

Building from Source
==================== 

In order to build from source you will probably need a lot of GNU
software (bash, make, gcc etc). They can be obtained through either the
MinGW or Cygwin projects. If you wish to use any other method for
building I'm afraid you are on your own.

   Please see the instructions in INSTALL. INSTALL can be opened in a
standard text editor.
